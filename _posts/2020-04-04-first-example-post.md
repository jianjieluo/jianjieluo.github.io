Inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's blog](http://karpathy.github.io/), I am going to write something recording my research path. This post is my first post to learn the use of [the website template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). I will share my thoughts, understanding, and works related to my research topics here, while the update frequency may be (very) low.
